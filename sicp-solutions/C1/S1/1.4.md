Exercise 1.4: Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

This function uses the `(if (> b 0) + -)` compound expression as an operator.
So if b is positive, it adds b. Else, it subtracts b.
